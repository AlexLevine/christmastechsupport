title: Software Updates
time: 5 minutes

The biggest thing you can do is to update the software on all of your devices.
This means computers, phones, tablets, routers, game consoles - pretty much
everything with a microchip. Most software updates don't add new features. They
fix security bugs. By not updating your software, you're leaving yourself
vulnerable to security glitches that hackers are well aware of.

## Long Explanation
WannaCry things.

## Setting Up
You should set up all devices to automatically install software updates. It's
just easier that way. Once a security update is released, hackers will learn
about the bug that update fixed. They can go after stragglers fairly quickly.

* [Windows 7,8,10][windows]
* [Mac][mac]
* Android: You can't update the operating system automatically. See [this
  link][android-apps] to see how to have apps update automatically.
* iOS: You can't update the operating system automatically. See [this
  link][ios-apps] to see how to have apps update automatically.
* Windows < 7: Please update to a newer version of Windows. Microsoft is no longer providing updates to these older versions of Windows.
* Linux: let's be real, if your relatives are using Linux, they don't need your help.
## Teaching
Not every update can be automatically updated (especially big updates on Apple
products). You should tell your relatives to either update as soon as they get
a notification or within x days of the first pop-up. The latter solution will
probably lead to a lot of uninstalled updates though.

## Avoiding Problems
Companies have a bad habit of adding features + security patches in the same
update. You may have to re-explain how certain features work since updates may
change them.
