Passwords suck. The best passwords are super hard to remember and websites
expose users' passwords all the time.

The best solution is to use a different, complicated password for every single
website. This can be really hard. Luckily, password managers can make it easy.
The two most popular are LastPass and 1Password, although there's a bunch more.

## Long Explanation
Meet Joe. Joe uses the same password on every website.

Joe has an account with example.com. One day, example.com leaks our their user
info. All of the usernames and passwords of all of the people who use
example.com are now on the Internet for anybody to see.

Meet Alice. Alice is a hacker. Alice downloads the list of usernames and
passwords from example.com. She picks one at random. It happens to be Bob's.

Alice starts going to every website she can think of and tries typing in Bob's
username and password.

Alice logs into Bob's Amazon account and starts ordering things with Bob's
credit card.

Alice logs into Bob's bank and wires his money away.

Alice logs into Bob's email and stops him from being able to reset his
passwords.

Don't be like Bob.

## Setting Up
You can do all of these steps on your own.

1. Download a password manager app onto a computer.
2. Setup an account using a unique password. I'd recommend paying the monthly
   fee for cloud syncing. It makes mobile access much easier.
3. Come up with a list of every digital account that your relatives have. At
   the very least, this list should have the following:
   * Email account
   * Facebook
   * Twitter
   * LinkedIn
   * Checking account
   * Investment accounts
   * Cell phone
4. Now comes the -boring- fun part! You have to log into each one of these
   accounts, change the password to be randomly generated, and then add the
   username/password to the password manager. Take my advice - just do this for
   them. Password managers occassionally mess up changing passwords. It's a lot
   of hassle if you change your password and can't find the new password
   anywhere. You don't have to do this to every account, but it's a good idea
   to get those important accounts above switched.
5. Install the password manager on tablets + phones. Do not turn on biometric
   recognition. Be sure to log in to the password manager once to verify
   everything is working properly.

## Teaching
* Have somebody create a fake email account using the password manager. Teach
  your relative how to have the password manager generate the password randomly
  and then have your relative login to the fake email account.

* Have your relative log into a couple mobile apps. Some mobile apps will have
  a little icon to open a password manager and others will require manually
  copying + pasting passwords.

## Avoiding Problems
* Most password managers don't handle changing passwords that well. Expect to
  be accidentally locked out of an account because your password manager didn't
  capture the password properly. I'd recommend changing the passwords yourself
  instead of teaching your relatives how to do it. If they want to change
  passwords, have them copy all generated passwords into a text file
  temporarily and manually verify that the password manager has it remembered.

* If you're close with your relatives, make a copy of their master password and
  store it in a secure place offline. This way, if they lose their password,
  you can help them recover access to their vaults.

* Some websites will allow symbols in their passwords and others won't. Some
  websites limit password length to x characters, some don't. You should make
  sure your relatives know how to play around with the settings on the password
  generator
